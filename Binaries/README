adding it as an argument in the format domain\username) you will be prompted for your old password
then asked for the new password which will be checked by sending the first 5 characters of the SHA1 hash to
the PwnedPasswords API and checking the rest internally against the results returned. If the password hasn't
been found you will be asked to confirm it and the password will then be changed if the old password matches.
